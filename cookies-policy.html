        <p><strong>What Are Cookies</strong></p>

        <p>
          As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site
          uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your
          computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what
          information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to
          store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these
          cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or 'break'
          certain elements of the sites functionality.
        </p>

        <p><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></p>

        <p>
          We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately
          in most cases there are no industry standard options for disabling
          cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features
          they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies
          if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used
          to provide a service that you use.

        <p><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong></p>
